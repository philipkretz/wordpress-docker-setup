# Wordpress docker-compose setup

- Contains a professional local dev setup for wordpress with docker-compose an nginx

- developed because I experienced some issues with mount paths as root in bitnami docker image

- Just run it via docker-compose up -d and setup wordpress on http://localhost:8000

- phpmyadmin is located under http://localhost:9000
